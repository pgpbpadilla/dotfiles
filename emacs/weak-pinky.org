* Weak pinky or pinky finger pain

  In order to reduce pain in my pinky fingers, I want to remap two common
  Emacs keys to more ergonomic ones:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (keymap-global-set "M-J" 'next-line)
    (keymap-global-set "M-I" 'previous-line)
  #+end_src

  
** *WARN*: =S= modifier not understood
  
   The actual secuences that I press are:

   1. =M-S-j= -> =M-J=
   2. =M-S-i= -> =M-I=


   For whatever reason sequences/expresions with the modifier =S= are
   not understood by =keymap-global-set=.
  
** Magit

   #+begin_src elisp
     (add-hook 'magit-status-mode
               (lambda ()
                 (keymap-set magit-mode-map "M-e"
                             'magit-section-backward)
                 (keymap-set magit-mode-map "M-f"
                             'magit-section-forward)))
   #+end_src

   
*** TODO j has a conflct with magit-jump-status

    1) [ ] study: https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/main/lisp/magit-section.el
    2) [ ] it seems that i/j won't work, however, M-I/J do work fine, maybe
       let's just call it quits?


** Annouce package

#+begin_src elisp
  (provide 'weak-pinky)
#+end_src
