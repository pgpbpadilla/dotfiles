* Weak pinky or pinky finger pain

** Motions
   
   In order to reduce pain in my pinky fingers, I want to remap two common
   Emacs keys to more ergonomic ones:

   #+begin_src elisp
     (keymap-global-set "M-J" 'next-line)
     (keymap-global-set "M-I" 'previous-line)
   #+end_src

  
*** *WARN*: =S= modifier not understood
  
    The actual secuences that I press are:

    1. =M-S-j= -> =M-J=
    2. =M-S-i= -> =M-I=


    For whatever reason sequences/expresions with the modifier =S= are
    not understood by =keymap-global-set=.
  

** TODO Undo: C-/
   

** TODO Org Agenda: up/down

   Remove :eval no when you find out the correct *-mode-map to use for Org Agenda keymaps: 
   
   #+begin_src elisp :eval no
     (add-hook 'magit-status-mode
               (lambda ()
                 (keymap-set magit-mode-map "M-e"
                             'magit-section-backward)
                 (keymap-set magit-mode-map "M-f"
                             'magit-section-forward)))
   #+end_src

*** Testing

    1. [ ] switch to target mode
    2. [ ] =C-h k=: check is the key binding is available.
       It's enough that the currently assigned key binding is one that
       I don't care to overwrite.

    1) [ ] study: https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/main/lisp/magit-section.el
    2) [ ] it seems that i/j won't work, however, M-I/J do work fine, maybe
       let's just call it quits?
