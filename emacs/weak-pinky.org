* Weak pinky or pinky finger pain

  In order to reduce pain in my pinky fingers, I want to remap two common
  Emacs keys to more ergonomic ones:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (keymap-global-set "M-J" 'next-line)
    (keymap-global-set "M-I" 'previous-line)

    (provide 'weak-pinky)
  #+end_src

  
** *WARN*: =S= modifier not understood
  
   The actual secuences that I press are:

   1. =M-S-j= -> =M-J=
   2. =M-S-i= -> =M-I=


   For whatever reason sequences/expresions with the modifier =S= are
   not understood by =keymap-global-set=.
