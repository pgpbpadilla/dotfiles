  The tangled [[file:bootstrap.el]] is the one that will be sym-linked as
  =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. It's main job is to prepare the stage for
  [[file:init.el]] by providing pre-requisites so that the init script can
  properly continue the configuration of Emacs.
  

** Define Org environment variables

   These variables need to be in the =bootstrap= file, since they
   depend on the specific computer.
