  The tangled [[file:bootstrap.el]] is the one that will be sym-linked as
  =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. It's main job is to prepare the stage for
  [[file:init.el]] by providing pre-requisites so that the init script can
  properly continue the configuration of Emacs.
  

** Define Org environment variables

   Set the GPG key(s) to be used for encrypting Org files, as well as
   the directories to use for specific categories of files:
   
   #+begin_src elisp
     (defvar pgpb-gpg-keys (list "pgpb.padilla@gmail.com"))
     (defvar pgpb-org-dirs (list
                            "~/org/31e520d4df" ;; agenda files
                            "~/org/0f6de25076" ;; journal files
                            "~/org/2204c36fc7" ;; archive files
                            )) 
   #+end_src

   These are expected by [[file:pgpb-org.org::#org-main][pgpb-org-main]] defined in [[file:pgpb-org.org]]. 
   
   
** Load the generic init script: [[file:init.el]]

   #+begin_src elisp
     (load "~/dotfiles/emacs/init.el")
   #+end_src
