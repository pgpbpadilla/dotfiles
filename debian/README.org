      These are all the things I had to do to setup Debian recently
      [2022-10-08 Sa]


** Install with =apt=

   Use the Brewfiles as a reference: [[file:~/dotfiles/homebrew/README.org][Homebrew]]


** Dropbox: [[https://www.dropbox.com/install][install]]

*** GOTCHA: throttle downloads: [[https://fast.com][speed test]]

    By default it will try to download everything as fast as possible,
    but that may impact your current work, so you can throttle it
    with:

    #+begin_src bash
      dropbox throttle 25000 15000
    #+end_src

    Speeds are in KBs
    

*** GOTCHA: there's no selective sync for linux

    Stop sync with:

    #+begin_src bash
      dropbox stop
    #+end_src

    Now you can setup your exclusion list.

    
**** Exclude list

     #+begin_example bash
     # general help
     dropbox 
     dropbox exclude list
     dropbox exclude add <foldername>
     #+end_example
